# HashedObjectCache Security and Bug Analysis

I have analyzed the `HashedObjectCache` implementation in `src/system/kernel/slab/HashedObjectCache.cpp` and have not found any obvious security vulnerabilities or bugs. The code appears to be well-written and uses appropriate locking to prevent race conditions. The use of a slab allocator is also a good choice for managing memory efficiently.

I have created a simple test case to ensure that the code is working as expected. The test case creates a new `HashedObjectCache`, allocates and frees an object, and then deletes the cache. The test passes without any errors.
