# System Library Security and Bug Analysis

## 1. `strcpy` Buffer Overflow

**Description:**
The `strcpy` function in `src/system/libroot/posix/string/strcpy.c` is vulnerable to buffer overflows. If the source string is larger than the destination buffer, the function will write past the end of the buffer, which can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:**
This vulnerability could be exploited by a local user to gain root privileges.

**Proposed Fix:**
Replace all uses of `strcpy` with `strlcpy`, which is a safer alternative that takes the size of the destination buffer as an argument.

## 2. `strncpy` Null-Termination Bug

**Description:**
The `strncpy` function in `src/system/libroot/posix/string/strncpy.cpp` does not null-terminate the destination string if the source string is exactly the size of the destination buffer. This can lead to buffer over-reads and other security vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**
This could be exploited by a local user to read sensitive information from the kernel's memory.

**Proposed Fix:**
Modify the `strncpy` function to always null-terminate the destination string.

## 3. `tmpnam` and `tempnam` Race Condition

**Description:**
The `tmpnam` and `tempnam` functions in `src/system/libroot/posix/stdio/tmpnam.c` and `src/system/libroot/posix/stdio/tempnam.c` are vulnerable to a race condition. If a malicious user can predict the name of the temporary file that will be created, they can create a symbolic link with the same name that points to a sensitive file. When the program then opens the temporary file, it will actually be opening the sensitive file, which could allow the user to read or modify it.

**Impact:**
This could be exploited by a local user to read or modify sensitive files, such as `/etc/passwd`.

**Proposed Fix:**
Replace all uses of `tmpnam` and `tempnam` with `mkstemp`, which is a safer alternative that creates a unique temporary file and returns a file descriptor to it.
