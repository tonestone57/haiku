    \brief Holds scheduler-specific data for a team, primarily for CPU quota management.

    Each team in the system that is subject to CPU quota controls will have an
    associated TeamSchedulerData structure. This structure tracks the team's
    CPU usage within a defined quota period, its allocated quota, and its
    fairness metrics for team-level scheduling decisions.
