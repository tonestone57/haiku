# Haiku USB Driver Vulnerability Report

## Introduction

This report details a potential vulnerability found in the Haiku USB driver. The vulnerability was found through manual code review. The report includes a description of the bug, its potential impact, and a proposed fix.

## Findings

### 1. Buffer Overflow in `Device::GetDescriptor`

**Description:** A buffer overflow can occur in the `Device::GetDescriptor` function, which is used to get a descriptor from a USB device. The function does not check if the `dataLength` parameter is larger than the actual size of the descriptor. This could lead to a buffer overflow, which could be exploited by a malicious user to execute arbitrary code in the kernel.

**Impact:** This vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious user to execute arbitrary code in the kernel.

**Proposed Fix:** A check should be added to the `Device::GetDescriptor` function to ensure that the `dataLength` parameter is not larger than the actual size of the descriptor. If the `dataLength` parameter is larger than the actual size of the descriptor, the function should return an error.

## Conclusion

The vulnerability described in this report could have a significant impact on the stability and security of the Haiku kernel. It is recommended that this issue be addressed as soon as possible. The proposed fix should be carefully reviewed and tested before it is applied to the kernel.
